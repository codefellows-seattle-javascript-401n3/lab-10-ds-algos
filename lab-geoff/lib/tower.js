// You are given three stacks (A, B, and C)
// Use your new implementation of a stack
// Located on Stack A are six disks (your solution should support n disks)
// The disk on bottom is the largest, and each disk above being smaller than that below
//
// The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the starting stack to a new stack (i.e. from A to C, or A to B), obeying the following rules:
//
// Only one disk can be moved at a time
// Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack
// No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
