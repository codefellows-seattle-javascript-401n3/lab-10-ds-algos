//pseudo code sincd i'm not going to get to this tonight.
//
// declare an array of numbers 1 - 6. (or 1 -3)
//
// declare 3 variables, one for each stack.  var x = new Stack();
//
// do a while loop...while target stack < array.length
//
// then it is a shit ton of if/else if statements for all the scenarios, checking for size.  if item X is larger than item Y, you cannot move it to the new stack.  if it is smaller, you can move it to the next stack...since i will have an even number of items, i will follow the wiki on the suggestion of movements.
